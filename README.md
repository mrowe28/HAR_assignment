#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset#

##Overview##

The objective of this project was to design an R script that effectively processes information from the UCI HAR dataset into tidy data.  The R script contained in this repo extracts subject, activity, and measurement data from separate files and combines it into a single data frame.  The script assigns labels to each variable in the data frame and subsets variables corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of study measurements  The retained data are sorted and the numeric activity codes are replaced with descriptive variable names.  A final processing step involves aggregating the data by calculating the mean for subsets of each measurement variable, grouped by subject and activity.  The resulting tidy data set is output as “tidy_HAR_dataset.txt”.    

##Included Files##

###Included in this repo are the following:###

-“run_analysis.R”: a script that processes the HAR data in accordance with the project guidelines

-”tidy_HAR_dataset.txt”: a copy of the tidy dataset generated by the R script

-”code_book.md”: a code book that describes the variables in the tidy dataset

-”README.md”: the file you are currently reading

##Required Files and R packages##

###The following raw data files from the HAR dataset must be present in the user’s working directory in order for “run_analysis.R” to function properly:###

-“activity_labels.txt”: this file indicates the numeric code for each activity included in the study

-“features.txt”: this file lists each variable measured in the study and its position in the data set

-“X_train.txt”: the training set measurement data

-“subject_train.txt”: the corresponding subject identification numbers for the training set data

-“y_train.txt”: the corresponding activity identification numbers for the training set data

-“X_test.txt”: the test set measurement data

-“subject_test.txt”: the corresponding subject identification numbers for the test set data

-“y_test.txt”: the corresponding activity identification numbers for the test set data

###In addition to the R base package, execution of “run_analysis.R” requires installation of the “dplyr” package.###

##R script outline##

###The list below summarizes the operations performed by “run_analysis.R” in generating the tidy dataset.###

1) read the subject and activity identification codes and activity measurements for the “test” dataset into R and combine them as a data frame

2) apply labels for the subject and activity variables to the data frame

3) extract labels for the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements from the “features.txt” file, reformat the labels for manipulation in R, correct typos, and apply modified labels to the data frame

4) repeat 1) and 2) to generate a data frame for the “training” dataset and apply the modified labels generated in 3) to the data frame

5) combine the “test” and “training” data frames into a single data frame

6) generate a numeric vector of indices that correspond to columns in the data frame in which the mean and standard deviation of activity measurements are stored by searching through the list of labels extracted from the “features.txt” file (indices for the subject and activity variables are also included in the vector).

7) use the numeric vector to subset the data frame and extract data for subject, activity, and mean and standard deviation of activity measurements

8) sort the subsetted data by subject and activity variables

9) replace the numeric activity identification codes with descriptive variable names

10) renumber row labels in sequential order

11) aggregate the data by calculating the mean for subsets of each measurement variable, grouped by subject and activity

12) output a .txt file (“tidy_HAR_dataset.txt”) containing the tidy data

##Suggestions for viewing the tidy dataset##

###The “tidy” dataset output by “run_analysis.R” may not appear to be particularly “tidy” if opened with a simple application such as TextEdit.  The following code is suggested for viewing the dataset in R:###

> mydata <- read.table(“tidy_HAR_dataset.txt”, header=TRUE)

> View(mydata)
